            One Piece manga is Oda's most famous work. The story of One Piece revolves around a pirate crew led by
            Captain Monkey D. Luffy. Each crew member has a goal he would like to achieve. The main goal of the captain
            is to find the legendary treasure “One Piece (the Rare Piece)” and become the Pirate King. The manga series
            began in 1997, while the anime began broadcasting in Japan in 1999 and is still going on. So far, 1,027
            episodes have been shown, between normal and special, in addition to twelve films.</p>

        <p class="p-OnePiece-9">its beginnings
            When he was young, Oda was influenced by Akira Toriyama, the writer of the famous manga "Dragon Ball", when
            Oda decided to become a mangaka. He always mentions that he was fond of pirate life from what he saw on TV
            and anime, especially Vicky The Viking. When he was young, Oda wrote a manga called the panda man, and he
            himself stated that he was making modifications to it to suit reality, and then he would display it soon out
            of childhood pride.

            In his seventeenth year, he wrote Oda Wanted!! He won numerous awards including second place in the Tazuka
            Competition, which earned him a job at Shonen Jump magazine. His traditional work as an assistant to Shinobu
            Kaitani was before he moved to Tokushiro Station, which gave him an unexpected influence in his career.
            
            In his nineteenth year, after moving to several places - most importantly working as an assistant to
            Nobuhiro Watasuki - he won the Qualifying Award for New Artists. Watasuki entrusted him with making the
            character Hanjo Kamatri that appears in Ronwei Kenshin. Throughout this period, Oda did two pirate works
            called Romance Down. At the same time, he drew the character Monkey D. Luffy, but not as it appears in the
            anime (that is, he modified it afterwards). Between 1996 and 1997 he had finished the story and the current
            drawing of Luffy as the protagonist, and modeled three of Luffy's companions on his three best friends at
            Hiroki Taki University - but he refused to reveal the names of the three anime or his friends.

            In 1997, One Piece first appeared in Shonen Jump magazine and became one of the most popular manga in Japan.
            Akira Toriyama, the author of Dragon Ball and Doctor Slam, was in a press interview. He was asked about the
            three best-loved manga for him after his books, and he replied: Two have made a so-called leap in the manga
            world, Toriyama and Oda with their work Dragon Ball One Piece.

            At first, Oda decided to make the One Piece manga start and end within five years, but he quickly changed
            his mind when he found that sales of the first manga chapter had reached the highest sales of manga chapters
            in Japan - at that time - and he stopped the manga and modified the story, making it reach 12 years and did
            not It ends so far and then resume the story in 1999 to continue until now.</p>
