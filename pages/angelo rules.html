        <p class="p-anglorules-1">Angelo Rules</p>
        <p class="p-anglorules-2">Angelo Rules (French: Angelo la Débrouille) is an animated series produced by France
            3,
            Teletoon, TeamTO and Cake Entertainment and directed by Chloé Miller and Franz Kirchner.[2] It is based on
            the book series Comment Faire Enrager... by Sylvie De Mathuisieulx and Sebastien Diologent. On 29 November
            2016, the series was renewed for a fourth season with 52 episodes.[3]
            Plot
            Angelo is the kid who tries to be the wise guy. He is constantly coming up with plans and strategies to get
            out of trouble. He’s determined as well that nothing will stand in the way of getting what he wants and he
            actually embraces challenges.

            Angelo isn’t put off by the natural setbacks most kids have to confront like parents, siblings and rules but
            that doesn’t deter him. He has a couple of really good friends who also help him in his strategic planning,
            like Sherwood, the king of logistics and Lola, the enthusiast. Together, they make a winning trio.</p>

        <p class="p-anglorules-5">Characters Main</p>
        <p class="p-anglorules-6">Angelo Lawrence (voiced by Jennifer Visalli) - The main protagonist of the show. He is
            typically a smart boy - with the skill to plan ahead and scheme out a problem - be it math teachers or
            boring field trips. He is joined by Sherwood, the king of logistics and Lola, whose enthusiasm can even
            eclipse his at times. Angelo knows his way around friends and family and knows their strengths and
            weaknesses. He thinks of Tracy as his archnemesis and doesn't stand for her evil ways. Angelo enjoys playing
            video games, skateboarding, basketball and socializing on social media website Buddy Page.
            Lola (voiced by Cassandra Lee Morris) - Angelo's neighbour who has known him a long time. She loves
            challenges and often encourages Angelo to go ahead with one of his plans. In addition, she has a cellphone,
            which helps the trio get up to even more revelling. However, she spends too much time talking on the phone.
            As of Series 4, she has a smartphone like all other characters on the show.
            Sherwood Forrest (voiced by Aaron Conley) - The "know-it-all" of the three friends. Sherwood's unseen
            parents are said to be very overprotective, so Sherwood prefers to make the most of his time with Angelo and
            Lola. He is often skeptical of Angelo’s plans, and he's usually the one to point out the possible logic
            flaws or potential problems. Sherwood feeds off Lola and Angelo's infectious enthusiasm, and he is lactose
            intolerant and allergic to nuts. In the episode "Fame", he becomes the mascot of a Japanese soda company
            after his phrase "Icky Bada" goes viral.</p>
        <p class="p-anglorules-7">Recurring Angelo's Family </p>
        <p class="p-anglorules-8">David "Dave" Lawrence (voiced by Doug Trapp) - The clumsy father of Elena, Angelo and
            Peter.
            He is forgetful, his weakness is children with teary eyes and he always asks his wife before giving a
            punishment. In the episode "Electra", his name is revealed to be Dave. In his childhood, he dreamed of
            becoming a rocker; this wish came true thanks to Angelo. Dave thinks his job is so boring that every time he
            presents it to anyone, he simply doesn't explain his real job properly, or he makes up a job, as exhibited
            in the episode "Fake Stuntman".
            Elena Lawrence (voiced by Katie DiCicco) - Angelo and Peter's 15 year-old sister. She first appeared in "Cat
            Box", merely as a secondary character, and her hair became shorter from Season 2. According to Angelo, she
            thinks that because she was born first, everyone should do what she says. She becomes more bossy and angry
            when dumped by her on-again-off-again boyfriend Hunter.
            Grandma Lawrence - Elena, Angelo and Peter's grandmother and Larisa's mother. She first appeared in the
            episode "The Casserole" and then again in "Clean Up".
            Larisa Lawrence (voiced by Gail Thomas) - The mother of Elena, Angelo and Peter.
            Peter Lawrence (voiced by Jackson Rheingold) - Angelo and Elena's little brother. He is five years old, and
            enjoys bouncing around the house like a chimpanzee (more commonly in Season 1). Peter often pulls out the
            "baby" card to get his way, and Angelo thinks he is spoiled. He appears to have an infactuation with Lola,
            once even calling her his favorite person. However, Lola just thinks of him as Angelo's cute baby brother.
            Peter has a very short attention span, as Angelo said in "Cat Box": "Cats are like little brothers, you can
            only keep them interested in a cool invention for five minutes".</p>
        <p class="p-anglorules-9">Angelo's School</p>

            Candy - Angelo's shy classmate and Monica's best friend. She is very timid and soft-spoken, although she has

            along with everyone because of his chill attitude.
            Tracy Flickinger (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) - The primary adversary of Angelo and his gang. Tracy is Mr.
            Foot's niece, and was first introduced in the episode "Bullicus Smarticus" in Season 2. She does display
            signs throughout the series depicting she has a crush on Angelo, and her evilness is her way of expressing
            it.
